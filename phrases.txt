TELL IT TO THE JUDGE
HOLD YOUR HORSES
KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
PIECE OF CAKE
ONCE IN A BLUE MOON
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
NO PAIN NO GAIN
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE
FISH OUT OF WATER
FINDING A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
THE LAST STRAW
IGNORANCE IS BLISS
YOU SNOOZE YOU LOSE
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
A DIME A DOZEN
I HATE TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE
BACK TO SQUARE ONE
CUT TO THE CHASE
TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
DOWN FOR THE COUNT
